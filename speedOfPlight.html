                 An arcade style racing game inspired by classics such as H2Overdrive. In the game you control a plane and have to race through the track before the timer hits 0, with each checkpoint resetting the timer.
                 <br/><br/>
                 Speed of Plight was the first game I ever made in Unreal Engine. I created it during my first year of University as part of an assignment. I knew I wanted to make a racing game for this project, but I didn't want to make a driving game as lots of my classmates were doing that, so I decided to take my game to the skies. Creating a plane racing game came with a number of challenges, such as giving the player full 3 dimensional movement whilst still constraining them to the track.
                 <br/><br/>
                 One of my goals with this project was to really nail the sense of speed felt by the player. I learnt all about post processing effects to create speed lines at the edge of the screen, motion blur, and tricks such as increasing the field of view on the camera when the player speeds up.
