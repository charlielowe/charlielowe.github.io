                 I made this game during my second year of University as a collaborative project, working with other game dev students as well as students from the Games Art and Design course. I played the role of Dev Lead, taking on the majority of the development as well as assinging tasks to other developers.
                 <br /><br />
                 There were 16 people in the team including concept artists, asset developers, indie devs, and game devs. I learned a lot during this project about working as part of a larger team, and all of the challenges that created.
                 <br /><br />
                 The brief for this project was given by Laurence Oldham, the head of game design at Frontier Developments. The brief stated that the game had to be multiplayer, and include aspects of deception and procedural generation.
                 <br /><br />
                 This was my first time making a multiplayer game, and it was a great learning opportunity. I learnt all about replication, the Unreal Gameplay Framework, the proper multiplayer development practises, and much more.
