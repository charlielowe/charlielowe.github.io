                    An arcade game made during a game jam hosted by my University. We had to not only make the game, but also design and decorate the arcade cabinet that the game was played in.<br /><br /> <b class="colourBlue">Team Size:</b> 5<br /> <b class="colourBlue">Time Frame:</b> 3.5 Days <br /> <b class="colourBlue">Engine:</b> Unreal Engine 5.4.4

                Bowlatro is a bowling game where you play against the ball. Choose where to place the pins and hope the ball doesn't knock them down. Spend your points in the shop to buy different types of pins which are harder to knock down or provide more points if left standing, and then rinse and repeat.

                I made this in a team of 5 people. I helped with many different parts of the project, including creating physical models to display on our arcade cabinet, developing parts of the game (main UI and menus), and making the main menu music.

                This game jam was a fun optional project we did as a way to wind down after our 5 month collaborative assignment. Due to the laid back nature of this game jam, it allowed us to be more relaxed and creative, which led to this being one of my favourite games I've made so far.'

                We showcased this game at the Norwich Games Festival launch party, and recieved lots of good feedback from various people from the games industry, as well as ways that we can improve the game if we continue to work on it.
