                 Bitmap Bygones is a short adventure game where the player has to populate a museum by going inside paintings and finding artifacts to bring back. The game was made as part of my university's Vertical Jam, a game jam where students from years 3 and 2 collaborated together over a week to make a game. The brief was given to us by the Sainsbury Centre Museum in Norwich, who told us the game had to include items from their museum.
                 <br /><br/>
                 The year 3 students in the game jam were the team leaders, and the year 2 students were junior developers. My contribution to the game was the fishing system, showcased in one of the levels, that I made with another developer from my year.
                 <br/><br />
                 I learnt a lot in this game jam about what it's like to work on a game as part of a large team, as well as working with a short deadline.
